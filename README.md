# AniList High-Contrast Dark-Theme

*Changelog at the bottom*

I did a major overhaul to the default dark-theme on AniList to improve accessibility for visual impairments where increased contrast is helpful but where dark themes are preferred.

## Known Issues
- The GraphiQL interactive editor is still light-themed.
- I want to increase font-sizes to make it more accessible. This theme is accessibility-focused in general.
